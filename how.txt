    ---------- How ----------
1. create a new column name isSynced (Boolean)
2. first time take all data and add one by one with isSynced value (true)
3. Next every time when get and add data from one table to another change the isSynced status from (false - true)

    ---------- Requirements ----------
1. When ever a new data entered by default the isSynced column value must be false (This will help to filter the data which are not synced yet)
